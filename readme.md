Regular expression with python
1. regular_expression_with_python3.py: i collect information about using regex with python
2. email_extractor.py: a small python code to read a string and extract email.
3. website_to_check_regex.txt: a nice website to check and understand regex
4. re_practice.py: just a small code practice with regex and counter with python
5. I just update a small python code to check if a string is a valid regex or not

Have fun coding!!!
